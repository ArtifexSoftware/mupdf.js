    Core API
    -----------------


    The core **JavaScript** file in `lib/mupdf.js` provides a low-level API which can be found within `MuPDF & JavaScript`_ on the main **MuPDF** documentation website.

    This documentation is tagged with |wasm_tag| for the relevant methods as **MuPDF.js** is based on WebAssembly_. 



    Node.js API
    ---------------------

    The **Core API** Web Assembly methods are exposed to **Node**, as such you anything you can do there, you can do in **Node**.

    See :ref:`How to Guide with Node.js <How_To_Guide_With_Node>` for more.
