Next.js
==========

The two projects in ``examples/nextjs`` together form the two halves
of a server-side web app.

Thin Client Side
----------------

The browser half of the project in ``examples/nextjs/nextjs-client`` talks to the server side using a REST API.

Server Side
-----------

The server half of the project in ``examples/nextjs/rest-server`` does the heavy lifting with MuPDF.js and provides
a REST API for the client side to call.
