Building Web Apps
=================

There are many ways to use MuPDF.js to build a web app.
We've prepared several examples you can look at, using
many of the popular JavaScript frameworks.

Note, these projects are deliberately light on features and are provided to get you started on the framework of your choice.

If you would like to suggest (or provide!) further framework examples or add features to the samples below please submit a PR and/or create an issue on our `MuPDF.js Github <https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/mupdf.js/>`_.
