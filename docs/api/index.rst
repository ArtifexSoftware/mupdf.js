API
===================


Core API
-----------------


The core **JavaScript** file in `lib/mupdf.js` provides a low-level API which can be found within `MuPDF & JavaScript`_ on the main MuPDF documentation website.

This documentation is tagged with |wasm_tag| for the relevant methods as **MuPDF.js** is based on WebAssembly_. 


.. note::

    Further, higher level API's will be defined as we evolve more **JavaScript** integrations.
