# Simple Viewer

This project contains a very simple demo of a PDF viewer using the MuPDF.js Library.

> You CANNOT run this from the file system!
>
> Modern web browsers refuse to load and run scripts from the file system, so
> this project must be served up by a web server.

Initialize the project:

	npm install

Then to start the HTTP server and open your browser to the viewer:

	npm start

Use the File menu to open a PDF file.
