# Miscellaneous Tasks

These examples come from the old "mupdf/mupdfjs" and "mupdf/tasks" modules.

The functions from these old modules have been separated out into their own
files so that you can pick and choose which ones you want to look at more
easily.

WARNING: These examples have not been very well tested, and are no longer maintained!
Use them at your own risk :)
