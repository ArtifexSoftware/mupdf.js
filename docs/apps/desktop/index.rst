Desktop Apps
============

You can also embed MuPDF.js in desktop apps, for example with Electron.



Electron
----------------

The `examples/electron <https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/mupdf.js/tree/master/examples/electron>`_ project is a very simple Electron project.

The project loads a PDF into the browser and renders the pages in a list through its "WebViewer" component.


Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have checked out the example from our `Github repository <https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/mupdf.js>`_ 
then do the following:


Initialize the project

.. code-block:: bash

	npm install

Start the server
""""""""""""""""""""""""
