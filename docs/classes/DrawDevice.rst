DrawDevice
===================

The `DrawDevice` can be used to render to a :doc:`Pixmap`; either by :ref:`running a PDFPage <PDFPage_run>` with it or by calling its methods directly.


|constructor_tag|

.. method:: DrawDevice(matrix: Matrix, pixmap: Pixmap)

    Create a device for drawing into a :doc:`Pixmap`. The :doc:`Pixmap` bounds used should match the transformed page bounds, or you can adjust them to only draw a part of the page.

    :arg matrix: :ref:`Matrix <Glossary_Matrix>`.
    :arg pixmap: :doc:`Pixmap`.

    :return: `DrawDevice`.

        var drawDevice = new mupdf.DrawDevice(mupdf.Matrix.identity, pixmap);
